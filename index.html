<h1 style="background-color:dodgerblue"; align=middle>Welcome to Literary Club!</h1>
<h3 style="color:blue"; align=middle><b>Hello and welcome to Literary Club! Half of this group is probably new <br>
and have no idea what to do. But don't worry, it won't be too hard. So here is where I'll let the<br>
teachers explain everything else but after they explain evrything and you've decided if you're going to do </b>
a solo, duo, or group, then<br> you just say whichever one you have chosen and I'll bring up the scripts and plays for<br>
whichever one you're doing. So yeah, that's pretty much all I have to say and this is the first time I'm doing this<br>
so if something doesn't work, please let me know and I'll try to fix it. </h3>
